Imbalanced Learning: Smart mix of RandomUnderSampler and SMOTE with k_neighbors=1 for rare classes.
 Column Alignment: Ensures both X_train and X_test have the same columns after dropping or transforming.
 Skewness Reduction: Uses multiple transformations including log and winsorization.
Class Cleanup: Removes minor classes to focus training on well-represented categories.
